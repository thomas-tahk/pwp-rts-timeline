            <h3>eSports - Birth and Rise of Modern Competitive Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                While competitive gaming didn't start with StarCraft or South Korea, eSports certainly did. eSports (e스포츠) was a term popularized, possibly coined by Korean Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism at the time, Park Jie Won(박지원) circa 1999-2000. What we now know as eSports would have never been possible if it weren't for the perfect storm of various historical, economic, social factors that converged at just the right time to make it possible for eSports to rise to prominence on the backs of RTS games, in particular Starcraft: Broodwar. In 1998, at time of Broodwar's release, government had recently subsidized internet and IT infrastructure as a way to attempt push the nation forward after a devastating blow to the economy from the International Monetary Fund crisis. This led to rise of PC Cafes (PC방) that took over most of pre-existing leisure spaces such as billiard clubs, arcades, etc. and made both internet and personal computing accessible to the mainstream audience. At the time, PC Cafes served as gateway to inexpensive access to internet, computing, and gaming and Starcraft quickly became the reason to visit such establishments. The phenomenon did not go unnoticed, with major businesses seeking marketing opportunities and in particular, major broadcasting channels (OnGameNet, MBC Games) picking up on the trend and starting to broadcast Starcraft competitions, with a panel of casters and commentators much like one that can be found in the traditional sports formats and hoisted its dedicated and skilled players to celebrity status. While the phenomenon was largely contained to South Korea, the rest of the world was able to experience the eSports phenomenon and hype shortly after the release of Starcraft 2 and subsequent GSL (GomTV Star League) competitions, which served as the model for other eSports games to follow.
