            <h3>Legacy of RTS: Standing the Test of Time</h3>
            <p>
                Legacy of RTS in competitive gaming and eSports is clear and outlined elsewhere, however, its influences and lasting marks on gaming and beyond are numerous. To summarize:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rise of Twitch.tv platform and other streaming platforms (Afreeca aka SOOP for KR) - Before Twitch, there was Justin. Justin decided to swerve away from a generalist content policy to focus on games due to popularity of Starcraft 2 at the time. Its first partnered influencer account (as in first to have a subscription available to his channel) was none other than Day[9] aka Sean Plott, who was a former Broodwar pro player, Starcraft 2 commentator, and Starcraft content creator.</li>
                <li>Online Gaming Mannerisms - RTS games (particularly starcraft along with some contemporary shooter games) popularized the practice of saying 'gg' (good game) 'glhf' (good luck have fun) as a form of sportsmanship and the derivative bad manner versions such as 'ggez' (good game easy) </li>
                <li>RTS-derived terms like 'Zerging' and 'cheesing' to the gaming vernacular - 'zerging/zerg rushing' usually refers to swarming objectives or enemies with numbers in any given game context as one would as a zerg player in starcraft. 'cheesing' refers to Konglish word that twisted the English word cheat to usually refer any cheap, dirty strategies that leave the victim of said tactics usually feeling angry and/or disappointed.</li>
                <li>Major non-RTS titles derived from official game or fan-created mods/maps - MOBAs originated from Starcraft and Warcraft custom maps. World of Warcraft, the definitive MMORPG of all time, was birthed from using the settings of Warcraft games and continued the plot thereafter.</li>
                <li>High bar for current and future devs - Many new studios and games are making their attempts to be included in the pantheon of RTS greats, many of them including former Blizzard/Westwood Studio devs. Battle Aces, Stormgate, ZeroSpace, Immortal Gates of Pyre, etc.</li>
            </ul>
