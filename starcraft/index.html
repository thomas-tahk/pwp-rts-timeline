            <p class="font-medium text-left">
                Broodwar is many things, but purely as a game, it is a beautiful, broken mess. Starcraft is a competitive RTS where the player has a choice among its 3 races of Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. The asymmetrical design of these three races combined with idiosyncrasies of the game that cover utilization of unique terrains, bugs, pathing, and other mechanical abnormalities gave it a depth of skill expression and adrenaline-inducing gameplay that Blizzard developers could not have fathomed in their wildest imaginations. Above all, Broodwar can be a punishingly difficult game especially against opponents who can outpace your skill to the point they could beat you with their feet at the controls (this has actually happened in Korean vs. foreigner in some showmatches as a sign of casual disregard and disrespect in cognizance of said skill gap). However, because it is so difficult, when strong players are matched up to play on the stage, the expression of their knowledge, skill, decision-making is an awesome thing to behold.
