    <h1>Milestone 2</h1>
    <p>The RTS Timeline site will be a single page visual timeline and will consist of at least the following sections:</p>
    <p><strong>What is RTS?:</strong> This section will introduce what the working definition of real time strategy games will be
        for the purposes of this site and its origins. This will also introduce some universally used terms/concepts in the genre</p>
    <p><strong>The Beginning - Dune 2?:</strong> This section will briefly go over what started to really count as the first
        recognizable RTS, specifically singling out Dune2.</p>
    <p><strong>The Golden Idols (Years): </strong> This section will cover some of the most recognizable and impactful releases
        in the genre concentrated in the mid to late 90s </p>
    <p><strong>Notables: </strong>This section will list some important/interesting additions to the genre beyond the 90s.</p>
    <p><strong>Indies: </strong>This section notes independent developers and their notable attempts at breaking out of the molds/shadow of the greatest games of the genre.</p>
    <p><strong>The New Wave: </strong>This section shows some of the latest or planned releases that attempt to innovate and
        go beyond the designs and features of the genre in the 2010s.</p>
    <p><strong>Legacy: </strong>This section will briefly detail how the RTS genre have led to birth/development of other aspects of video games.</p>
    <p><strong>E-sports & Community: </strong>This will be a shallow coverage of how the RTS (in particular Starcraft) birthed and molded
    competitive gaming as a whole as we know it in its current form and some of the most important players/events/developments.</p>
    <p><strong>Credits: </strong>This section will list the sources of my research for the contents of this site. In addition,
    I will also list some of my personal links (github, linked-in)</p>
