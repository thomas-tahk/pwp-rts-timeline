            <hr>
            <p class='purpose'><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is a front-end website that aims to inform on and celebrate the history of various games that defined the Real Time Strategy genre using a visual timeline.</p>
            <p class='audience'><strong>Audience:</strong> This site is designed primarily for fans, players both current and former, and anyone else curious enough to learn more about the genre. This site is also serving as a demonstration to potential employers in video game development, publishing, or content creation.</p>
            <p class='goal'><strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal of this site is to share information and enthusiasm about RTS video games and their history with an opportunity for users to reach out to me to comment/discuss on the content, note corrections, etc. I also hope to use this website as a way to demonstrate some of my abilities in web development to a potential employer. </p>

            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Name: </strong>Samuel D. Webber</p>
            <p><strong>Age: </strong>38</p>
            <p><strong>Role/Profession: </strong>Co-Founder and Lead Developer at Lava Golems, recently established independent video game studio that has a spot for a web developer who is a good fit for the team to support the project through launch and beyond. Also, a big fan of older strategy game genres like 4X, RTS since childhood. </p>
            <p><strong>Devices: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A power user dual booting Linux and Windows 11 on the desktop. Sam's desktop PC has some of the better hardware on the market to handle graphically intensive games and development tools. </li>
                <li>Steam Deck running Steam OS to have access to Steam platform and library on the go</li>
                <li>Nintendo Switch and PS5 Pro for gaming consoles.</li>
                <li>Latest Samsung phone running latest Android OS</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spends more time in meetings than he cares for and finds it ironic he spends less time developing as lead developer than he used to earlier in his career</li>
                <li>Looks online and attends various events to discover hidden gems (both people and games)</li>
                <li>Has access to most video games on various platforms yet rarely can find the time or motivation to play long sessions or play to completion, more often a tool for research than entertainment </li>
                <li>Interacts with various people in both player and developer communities to broaden his perspective on what ideas and games currently resonate in the populace</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Needs and Frustrations: </strong>
                <br> Samuel is looking for outlets outside work where he can set aside his developer hat and just be a fan and indulge in the enthusiasm, hype, and nostalgia. He's also always on the lookout for more good people to join the game dev ranks with an obvious bias towards his own teams, but he's not above giving recommendations to other places in the industry if it makes sense. He has noticed that especially in recent times, finding new additions to the team is a laborious and expensive process in time, money, and other resources. It’s rare to find someone with the right combination of experience, growth oriented mindset, and enthusiasm for the work and product. He wants to work with someone who wants to make and play similar kinds of games (almost) as much as he does. </p>
            <p><strong>Goals: </strong> Samuel is looking forward to learning a few things about some of his favorite games from the past and seeing how their histories connect from their origins to the present as well as how this site's presentation matches with his own memories and blasts from the past. He's also evaluating the developer of this website on a few criteria such as: Does this person have a passion for building things and video games? Does this person possess skills/experience apparent in their work to do their job? Can I imagine this person working in my studio?</p>
            <p><strong>User Story: </strong>As a user, I want to appreciate and enjoy the content the site’s developer has curated and the option to communicate with that developer about it. I am also determining whether this web developer may be a good fit for the project or the team at the studio.</p>
