            <h3>Role/Profession:</h3>
            <p>Co-Founder and Lead Developer at Lava Golem, recently established video game studio that has a spot for a web developer who is a good fit for the team to support the project through launch and beyond. Also a big fan of the RTS genre since childhood. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A power user dual booting Linux and Windows 11 on the desktop. The desktop PC has some of the better hardware on the market to handle CPU and graphically intensive games and rendering software. </li>
                <li>Steam Deck running Steam OS to have access to Steam on the go</li>
                <li>Nintendo Switch and PS5 Pro for gaming consoles.</li>
                <li>Latest Samsung phone running latest Android OS</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>spends more time in meetings than he cares for and finds it ironic he spends less time developing as lead developer than he used to earlier in his career</li>
                <li>looks online and attends various events to discover hidden gems (both people and games)</li>
                <li>likes interacting with various people in both fans and developer communities to broaden his perspective on what ideas and games currently resonate in the populace</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Needs and Frustrations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Samuel is looking for outlets outside work where he can set aside his developer hat and just be a fan and indulge in the enthusiasm, hype, and nostalgia.</li>
                <li>Simultaneously, Samuel is looking to recommend additions to the team for someone who is willing and capable of starting on the team running while being a good culture fit. Samuel has noticed lately that partly due to AI, there are more time, resources, and energy spent than ever to just weed out irrelevant and underqualified candidates.  It’s rare to find someone with the right combination of experience, growth oriented mindset, and enthusiasm for the work and product. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking to geek out and indulge in nostalgia over some of his favorite games</li>
                <li>Looking to fill in a position on the team with someone who can contribute meaningfully with little onboarding, has long term outlook for the studio/project, and is a good culture fit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User Story</h3>
            <p>As a user, I want to appreciate and enjoy the content the site’s developer has curated and be able to talk about it to that developer. In the back of my mind, I am also determining whether this developer may be a good fit for my team at work. </p>
