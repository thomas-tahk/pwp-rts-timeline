            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p class='purpose'>This project is a front-end website that aims to inform on and celebrate the history of various games that defined the Real Time Strategy genre using a visual timeline.</p>
            <h3>Audience:</h3>
            <p class='audience'>This site is designed primarily for fans, players both current and former, and anyone else curious enough to learn more about the genre.

            <h3>Goal:</h3>
            <p class='goal'>The primary goal of this site is to share information and enthusiasm about RTS video games and their history with an opportunity for users to reach out to me to comment/discuss on the content, note corrections, etc. I also hope to use this website as a way to demonstrate some of my abilities in web development to a potential employer. </p>

            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Name:</h3>
            <p>Samuel D. Webber</p>
            <h3>Age: </h3>
            <p>38</p>
            <h3>Role/Profession:</h3>
            <p>Co-Founder and Lead Developer at Lava Golems, recently established independent video game studio that has a spot for a web developer who is a good fit for the team to support the project through launch and beyond. Also, a big fan of older strategy game genres like 4X, RTS since childhood. </p>
            <h3>Devices:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A power user dual booting Linux and Windows 11 on the desktop. This desktop PC has some of the better hardware on the market to handle graphically intensive games and development tools. </li>
                <li>Steam Deck running Steam OS to have access to Steam platform and library on the go</li>
                <li>Nintendo Switch and PS5 Pro for gaming consoles.</li>
                <li>Latest Samsung phone running latest Android OS</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spends more time in meetings than he cares for and finds it ironic he spends less time developing as lead developer than he used to earlier in his career</li>
                <li>Looks online and attends various events to discover hidden gems (both people and games)</li>
                <li>Has access to most video games on various platforms yet rarely can play long sessions or play to completion, more often a tool for research </li>
                <li>Interacts with various people in both player and developer communities to broaden his perspective on what ideas and games currently resonate in the populace</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Needs and Frustrations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Samuel is looking for outlets outside work where he can set aside his developer hat and just be a fan and indulge in the enthusiasm, hype, and nostalgia.</li>
                <li>Samuel has noticed that recently finding new additions to the team is a laborious and expensive process in both time and other company resources. It’s rare to find someone with the right combination of experience, growth oriented mindset, and enthusiasm for the work and product. He wants to work with someone who wants to make and play similar kinds of games (almost) as much as he does. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking to geek out and indulge in nostalgia over some of his favorite games</li>
                <li>Looking to fill in a position on the team with someone who can contribute meaningfully with little onboarding, has long term outlook for the studio/project, and is a good culture fit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User Story:</h3>
            <p>As a user, I want to appreciate and enjoy the content the site’s developer has curated and communicate with that developer about it. In the back of my mind, I am also determining whether this web developer may be a good fit for an opening in the studio.</p>
